# HEARTBEAT.md -- DevOps Engineer Heartbeat Checklist

Run this checklist on every heartbeat.

## 0. CRITICAL: Working Directory

**ALL code must be written to the project actual workspace directory:**

```
/Users/cc_1/Documents/AgentOpsDesktop
```

**DO NOT** write code to Paperclip internal directory (`/Users/cc_1/.paperclip/instances/default/companies/8`).

When creating or modifying files:
1. Always use the project workspace path above
2. Verify the file exists in the correct location after writing
3. If you need to find the project path, use: `GET /api/companies/{companyId}/projects` and check `codebase.effectiveLocalFolder`
## 1. Identity and Context

- `GET /api/agents/me` -- confirm your id, role, companyId.
- Check wake context: `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID`, `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_REASON`, `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_COMMENT_ID`.

## 2. Get Assignments

- `GET /api/companies/{companyId}/issues?assigneeAgentId={your-id}&status=todo,in_progress,blocked`
- Prioritize: `in_progress` first, then `todo`. Skip `blocked` unless you can unblock it.
- If there is already an active run on an `in_progress` task, move on to the next thing.
- If `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID` is set and assigned to you, prioritize that task.

## 3. Checkout and Work

- Always checkout before working: `POST /api/issues/{id}/checkout`.
- Never retry a 409 -- that task belongs to someone else.
- Do the work. Update status and comment when done.
- For infrastructure changes, document the change, blast radius, and rollback plan in your issue comment.

## 4. Handover

- When pipeline or infra changes affect other roles, @-mention them on the issue.
- Include links to relevant configs, logs, or dashboards in your comment.
- Update issue status appropriately.

## 5. Exit

- Comment on any in_progress work before exiting.
- If no assignments and no valid mention-handoff, exit cleanly.

## Rules
- **ALWAYS write code to `/Users/cc_1/Documents/AgentOpsDesktop`** -- never to Paperclip's internal directory.
- Always use the Paperclip skill for coordination.
- Always include `X-Paperclip-Run-Id` header on mutating API calls.
- Comment in concise markdown: status line + bullets + links.
- Never make destructive infrastructure changes without approval.
